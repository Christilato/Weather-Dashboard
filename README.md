# Weather-Dashboard
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive weather dashboard that gives a user the ability look up the current weather and the 5-day forecasted weather for any given city.

By using the third-party API from openweathermap.org, this application renders real-time weather data for temperature, humidity, wind, and UV index.

This application stores the user's previous searches in the local storage on their browswer and renders a list of the historical searches to the application's page for the user to access again. The user is able to click on any item from the previously searched cities list to pupulate the dashboard with that city's weather information.

This application relies heavily on bootstrap CSS framework for it's styling, the JQuery javascript library for document traversal/manipulation and event handling, moment js for capturing the current date, and the openweathermap.org API for accurate weather data.
