AS a traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly. 
I should be able to type in the city and bring in all the weather data corresponding to the current city. It should let you know the temperature, wind, humidity. It should also bring in a 5day forecast for that current city.
